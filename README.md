# Chess AI with Minimax Algorithm

## Description
The Chess AI with Minimax Algorithm project is a Python implementation of an artificial intelligence system capable of playing chess against human opponents or other AIs. Built upon the principles of the Minimax algorithm, this AI evaluates potential moves by recursively exploring future game states and selecting the move that maximizes its chances of winning while minimizing the opponent's. By simulating various hypothetical game scenarios, the AI can anticipate and respond to different strategies, making it a formidable opponent for chess enthusiasts of all skill levels. This project serves as both an educational resource for understanding AI techniques in board games and a practical demonstration of AI's strategic decision-making capabilities.

## Overall Architecture
1. **Game Engine**: Manages the game state, including the chessboard, current player, legal moves, and game outcome. The game engine provides functions for generating legal moves, applying moves to the board, checking for checkmate and stalemate conditions, and determining the winner of the game.
2. **Minimax Algorithm**: Implements the core decision-making logic of the AI, recursively evaluating potential moves and selecting the optimal one. The Minimax algorithm operates by exploring the game tree to a specified depth, considering all possible moves and their consequences, and selecting the move that leads to the most favorable outcome for the AI.
3. **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Enhances the efficiency of the Minimax algorithm by pruning branches of the game tree that are unlikely to lead to optimal outcomes. By maintaining lower and upper bounds (alpha and beta) on the possible values of nodes, Alpha-Beta pruning avoids unnecessary evaluations and focuses on the most promising branches of the game tree
4. **Evaluation Function**: Computes a heuristic evaluation score for game positions based on various factors, such as material balance, positional advantages, and potential future moves. The evaluation function assigns numerical values to these factors and combines them into an overall evaluation score, allowing the AI to quickly assess the quality of different game positions and make informed decisions.
5. **User Interface**: Provides an interactive interface for users to interact with the AI, make moves on the chessboard, and receive real-time feedback on game progress. The user interface allows users to play against the AI, engage in two-player mode, or observe the AI's evaluation of different game positions. Users can customize various settings, such as the AI's search depth and evaluation metrics, to tailor the gameplay experience to their preferences.


## Algorithms

### Minimax Algorithm
The Minimax algorithm is a recursive search algorithm used to determine the optimal move for a player in a two-player, zero-sum game. At each level of the game tree, the algorithm alternates between maximizing the AI's potential gain (assuming the opponent plays optimally) and minimizing the opponent's potential gain (assuming the AI plays optimally). By recursively exploring future game states to a specified depth and evaluating the utility of terminal states (win, loss, or draw), the algorithm selects the move that leads to the most favorable outcome for the AI.

### Negamax Algorithm
Negamax is a variation of the Minimax algorithm that simplifies the implementation by combining the maximizing and minimizing steps into a single recursive function. Instead of alternating between maximizing and minimizing players, Negamax treats all players as maximizing players and negates the evaluation scores of child nodes. This simplification allows for more concise and efficient code while achieving the same results as the traditional Minimax algorithm.

### Alpha-Beta Pruning
Alpha-Beta pruning is an optimization technique applied to the Minimax algorithm to reduce the number of nodes evaluated in the game tree. By maintaining lower and upper bounds (alpha and beta) on the possible values of nodes, the algorithm can discard branches of the tree that are unlikely to lead to optimal outcomes. Alpha-Beta pruning exploits the property of symmetry in the game tree, where the same position can be reached through different move sequences, to avoid redundant evaluations and focus on the most promising branches.
